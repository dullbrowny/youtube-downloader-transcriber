Let's go Question number 1, now you have to tell the device used for measuring temperature now what is the device in these four options which we use to measure the temperature option number 1, thermometer, B, meter, C, animometer, D meter so students measure temperature A, thermometer, device, is that clear? so collect answer is option number A, thermometer now moving towards the next question, question number 2 the unit of measurement of temperature we know the temperature, how we measure Celsius scale, Kelvin scale or Fahrenheit scale so what we measure in meter? what we measure in kilogram? what we measure in degree Celsius? what we measure in second temperature? no so correct answer should be option number C, degree Celsius now question number 3, the normal temperature of human body our body which is very much in temperature which we call normal and if we are more than 1-2 degrees then we are hospitalized, we are getting tired, we are getting sick, we are getting fever so something will be a range which is normal and we are getting sick so the range of body temperature is 37 degrees do we have 40 degrees normal? no, 37 degrees normal? yes, 42, no, 35, no 35-37 normal we know but accurate to normal body temperature is 37 degrees is that clear? let us go question number 4, the maximum and the minimum temperature of a day are measured with now what is the scale which we measure in temperature? what we measure in temperature? so you will notice whenever you see weather forecast so weather forecast, you always tell us the temperature of 2 types minimum and maximum, it will be today, minimum will be going to 35 degrees and today maximum will be going to 41 degrees so minimum and maximum scale, we always do weather so weather forecast, whenever temperature is in the range of students minimum and maximum, now we go to a Celsius thermometer, no, fairnight thermometer, no maximum and minimum thermometer, yes, Kelvin thermometer, no so correct answer should be maximum and minimum thermometer you will notice whenever weather forecast goes to 2 values, minimum temperature, maximum temperature because weather is always measured on the minimum temperature scale now question number 5, the liquid metal used in thermometer this is always in liquid state, this is in the calculate temperature this is also in clinical thermometer, laboratory thermometer now tell me, which is this metal? why is this metal mercury? silver, gas metal, gold, copper so this metal, in every room temperature, how is this liquid? and from which we calculate temperature, this metal is called mercury is that clear? so correct option is option number A mercury question number 6, what is the use of kink in a thermometer? now students know that our thermometer is about to be 1 clinical thermometer what is this? clinical thermometer clinical thermometer is used in daily life, in day to day life when patient's temperature is increasing, when the fever is coming, then they use it at home now you will notice, there is one thing in this end, which we call bulb now what is inside this bulb? mercury is present in this bulb so inside this bulb is mercury and as we place the thermometer inside the mouth of the patient, then if our temperature is 38 degrees so where is this mercury? it is 38 degrees and students will notice that if you take this thermometer out of the mouth, then this mercury is also at 38 degrees so what is the thing that mercury is coming from the back? so students, this is the thing that we call this type of kink and because of this kink, as we are taking the thermometer out of the mouth, mercury level falls down because the temperature is 38 degrees inside the body but outside the mouth is different temperature, so you will notice that the temperature outside the mouth is 40 degrees so the thermometer should be increased, it is not like that so why is the temperature of the body staying there? because in thermometer, what is present? kink and this kink is stopped from coming back is that clear? so this is the level of mercury that prevents the fall down and students say kink and remember that kink is always in clinical thermometer laboratory, in thermometers, kink is not present so what is the use of kink in the thermometer? option A, it prevents mercury level from falling on its own, it raises the mercury level it makes a thermometer look beautiful? no it acts as a joint to the glass tube that is used for mercury and the skill it is absolutely wrong now tell us what is the correct answer? option A, it prevents the mercury level to fall down so let us get clear question number 7, the process by which heat flows from the hotter end to the cooler end such things that say heat, hot end, say cool end we say transfer of heat and if there is an object what is the object? this object is solid and we know how to transfer of heat in solids with the help of conduction so in solids, we always transfer heat in hot end, how to transfer it with the help of conduction so what is the correct answer? option number A, conduction next question, question number 8, the process by which transfer of heat takes place by the actual movement of particles now tell me, when we saw an experiment, we had a flash in it and we had poured water in it and if I put this flash on a burner, then here I have provided heat as I have provided heat, the molecules that are below the surface will be heated quickly so the most below molecules, water gets heated quickly and they go up and these cool molecules, they go down from the side to the bottom and this way the entire water will be heated together and will be heated so what is the convection process of heat transfer? so here the transfer of heat takes place by the actual movement of particles so the particles that are below are above the surface, so here the movement of particles is being done so the movement of particles is being transferred from the heat, in liquid and this movement of particles is a step so what is the convection? so here the correct answer should be option number B, convection is the process in which the movement of particles is being transferred from the liquid, the particles are heated quickly they go up and the surface is cooled down and it goes down from the side and it takes time when the entire water goes down from the side so this process is being transferred from the movement of particles to the heat so what we call it is convection very good so correct answer is option number B convection no question number 9, the transfer of heat which does not require any medium is called radiation radiation is such a process, the sun is the sun, how is the sun being heated till the heat? the sun will be heated till the heat is heated with the help of radiation so if it is vacuum or air, then it is medium or not, radiation is being heated so we call it as transfer of heat which does not require any medium is radiation so correct answer should be option number C radiation the process by which heat comes from the sun to earth, I just gave you the example the process which we call it radiation is that clear? which is conduction? which is conduction? which is conduction? which is in solids? which is convection, liquid and air okay vaporization, liquid and radiation when it is medium or not, then we call it radiation so correct answer is option number C radiation now question number 11 in case of dash the cool air moves from the land towards the sea is land breeze so land breeze is a situation where the air is being heated from the land so what is the answer? is that clear? let us go question number 12 sunlight reaches the earth's surface through we know what radiation so here in the radiation we have the power of our earth question number 13 which of the following is an insulator? and insulator means that heat transfer does not allow, so they do not allow heat transfer so the heat transfer does not allow, air is a bad conductor of heat so correct answer is option number B air now question number 14 stainless steel pans are usually provided with copper bottom our house pans and stainless steel are made of copper, why is the band of copper? because copper is a good conductor of steel, so copper can transfer heat from the good heat so the food that you have to cook will be cooked from the good heat, so the band of copper is made of copper because copper is a better and good conductor of heat now copper option A copper bottom makes a pan modulable, it is not that bad because copper can be used for a lot of time, it is not that bad such pans appear colourful, it has a colourful, it is not that bad copper is easier to clean, no, the correct answer is copper is better conductor of heat than stainless steel and your food will be cooked from the good heat, because it is made of heat from the good heat is that clear, let us go now question number 5 light colour clothes are prefer during summers because light colour absorb less heat, light colour absorb less heat and they reflect more heat, they reflect more heat when they absorb less heat, they will be less hot so we need less heat, we need to be warm, we need to be cool, we need to wear dark clothes for warm but when we need to be cool, what will we prefer? light colour clothes why? because light colour clothes will absorb less heat and more heat, we need to be cool, we need to be cool so we prefer the colour clothes for the summers is that clear? question number 16 1 litre of water at 30 degrees first we have taken a mug, we have taken 3 degrees water second we have taken 50 degrees water, when we have taken 2 no what is the temperature of the water? you have noticed that you have to take a few times, where is the temperature? it is warm, so when we have taken 30 degrees and 50 degrees, then where will the temperature end of 50 degrees? so what is the temperature of this water? 30 and 50 degrees in the middle of the water, so what is the correct answer? it should be between 30 and 50 degrees, is that clear? let's go question number 17 the flow of heat by conduction is generally observed in we look at the conditions in solids so what is the correct answer here? option number A solid next question number 18 name the device which is used to measure the hotness and the coolness of an object we also tell you how this object is hot, it is hot, it is hot, it will be hot, it will be hot, it is hot, it is cold so the temperature of that thing is in it, if it is 40 degrees, it is cold, it is minus 40 degrees, so it is very hot, I have told you if it is minus 40 degrees, it is very cold, it is 40 degrees, so it is very hot, so there is no temperature of anything, when it is too hot, it is hot, there is no temperature of anything, it is less, it is cold, so what is the temperature? any degree or any measure of the degree of hotness and coolness, so the correct answer should be, here you have to tell the device which is calculated temperature, so that device is thermometer, not peak meter, not barometer, pressure is not there, correct answer is thermometer, so what is the device that we calculate BP, so I will tell you, the name of such device, in which we calculate blood pressure in the daily life of a person, tell me in the comment section, what do we call such device that we calculate BP, so this is your extra edge question, which we have given you in the past, and you will also tell me in the comment section, that what do we call the machine to calculate BP, what do we call that instrument, which we calculate BP, let us go, in the next session, I will ask you, which child is the correct answer, now question 1119, the correct method of reading a clinical thermometer is, now the clinical thermometer is correct, what is the correct method, first, holding the thermometer by bulb, not even a single thermometer is not able to catch the bulb, because your hands will be placed in that bulb, and when you put it in the mouth of the patient's patient, then it will be more infection, so never catch the thermometer by the bulb, we will always catch the right, because the use of mercury level should be, before the use of mercury level should be below 39 degree, do not hold the thermometer by the bulb correct, we will not catch the bulb from the body, here holding the thermometer by the bulb, not able to catch the bulb, before the use of mercury level should be, once it is below 35, it should not be below 39 degree, so correct option should be option number c, that we will never catch the bulb from the thermometer, now question 20, which thermometer records the highest and lowest temperature, I just told you that when we look at the forecast of the weather, we see temperatures for the weather, for that thermometers use, or in many labs, what is the thermometer used, maximum and minimum thermometers, lowest and highest thermometers are used, so what we call as the thermometers, maximum and minimum thermometers, is that clear, which is used in lab, clinical life is not used in clinical life, question 21, temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object, so temperature, what we will tell you, that there is no such thing as much heat, is that clear, so correct answer should be option number a, hotness of an object, now question 22, expansion of a substance on heating depends on, what is the thing which depends on, expansion of an object, what is the thing which depends on, expansion, first of all, nature of an substance, of course, nature decides that, no object is as much as expand, rise in temperature, because when we increase the temperature of an object, then the particles inside the object are, they are active, so when their activity is increased, then what is the increase in the kinetic energy, the energy of the objects will increase, and as soon as the energy of the energy increases, the heat will produce more, so here, correct answer, option number c, both a and b, is that clear, we will see, so nature will depend on, 7, 7, rise in temperature, will depend on, as soon as the temperature increases, kinetic energy between the molecule increases, and as such, the motion becomes more, molecules inside, moving towards next question, question number 23, the substance which conduct heat easily, now, as such, substance which conduct heat easily, what we call as good conductors, and what are their examples, aluminum, steel, copper, gold, which give heat to transfer well, they are good conductors, and that is why we call them conductors, good, is that clear, question number 24, which of the following thermometer contains mercury, clinical thermometer, yes, laboratory thermometer, yes, so correct answer should be, both a and b, so clinical thermometer may be mercury, and laboratory thermometer may be mercury present, so, both of them are present in thermometers, so correct answer is, option number c, both a and b, now, question number 25, the phenomena, involves in the formation of land breeze and sea breeze, here, what is the air? and we know that, air, can be called heat, transfer, which is, with the help of convection, so correct answer, option number b, air, never forget that, in solids, in solids, heat transfer, conduction, solid, heat transfer, conduction, liquid, and air, liquid, and air, heat transfer, convection, liquid, and air, heat transfer, convection, and when we need to be medium, then, transfer, will be radiation, is that clear? then, transfer, will be radiation, so, this thing, we will never forget, sometimes, is that clear? so, the phenomena, involves in the formation of land and sea breeze, this is the air, and the heat transfer, is in the air, with the help of convection, is that clear? let's get to the next question, we have the next question, the next question, which thermometer, is used to measure, temperature of different things and places? now, we are not humans, we have to see the chemicals of different things, the chemical, the liquid temperature, so, that, we will use the thermometer, which thermometer, so, the laboratory thermometer, is the use of the thermometers, when we are using the human body, Equates ke boiling point, freezing point, chemicals ke physical properties ke bari me pataona chahiye. Tab hum experiment karte hai lab ske an dar. And labs me joth hamo meter use ho te hai bohen laboratory treat hamo meters. Is that clear? Chaliyam. Question number 27. The clinical hamo meter presently you in use in India amar dhe with temperature scale. This scale correspond to which of the following. India me do typ ke scale use ho te hai, Celsius and Fahrenheit be hi use ho a karta tha lika nbohal zawane pe le, abo Fahrenheit use nahi ho ta abzadata Celsius scale he use ho te hai. But Fahrenheit scale be hi use ho a karta te hai but in the past. Pat recent lia ver question aay to aap ko tick ka na hai, Celsius scale pe, jo ab most commonly use ho te hai. Is that clear? Chaliyu. Question number 27. Which of the following is a good conductor of heat? Heat ka chakandaktor kaun sa hai. Iron. Yes. Steel. Bilkul yes. Eluminium yes. To correct answer ka onachhe. All of the above. This sabhi heat ko transfer hone de te hai. And why is this solid? And we know that in solid, heat ka transfer kese ho te hai. With the help of conduction. So haam ye nahi bholainghe ki solid me heat ka transfer ho ta hai. Conductions se. Is that clear? So correct answer is mi ki aonachhe. Option number D all of the above. Now question number 29. A marble tile aap notis karte ho ki aagar aap ke ghar me, ju marble ke tiles ho ta hai. Voha thand ke mo asam me, pohaa zawada thandi ho ta hai. Lekin agar usi jaga, Vodke tiles hai to voh itne zada thandi nahi ho te. So asa kyu ho ta hai, students. Ki ju marble ke tile hai, voh zada thandi ho te hai, Vodke compare me. Kyu ki students, Vod jo hai, voh kya hai, Vod is a bad conductor of heat. To ju vood hai, Vod is a bad conductor of heat. Vodke ki vod is a bad conductor of heat. Vod transfer of heat, nahi ho nidega. Or marble jo hai. Or marble jo hai. Marble is a good conductor of heat. And isiliya wo heat ka transfer ho nidega. To ju marble ke tiles ho ta hai. Kyu ki winteras me thandak zada rati hai. To marble ke tiles ho ta hai. And Vod, kyu ki Vod insulator hai, heat ka wo heat ka transfer ho nidega. Isiliya wo thandan nahi par thandi ke timei. Is that clear? So option a hai, is it is a better conductor of heat than Vod. Bilkul sai. Marble is a better conductor of heat than Vod. Is polish while Vod tile is not polished. Polishing se koilin na dena nahi hai. Rhe ssi, reflect se moor heat, then Vod tile, no. Now, is a poor conductor of heat than the Vod in tile, galat. So correct answer kya hai. Option number a, marble tile is a better conductor of heat than Vod in tile. Is that clear? Chaliyem. Question number 30, metals are conductors of heat. They are average, no, they are poor conductors of heat, no. But they are good conductors of heat. D, sum are poor conductors? No. The poor conductors of heat are what we call as insulators. Is that clear? So metals are good conductors of heat. Is that clear? Jase ki gold aluminium. Ye sab ka ka koppur metals. Yo ye sab good conductor of heat. Or jo metals heat conducthi ni karte, wo insulators, o te hai, like plastics, wo, jase, insulators, a, because they do not allow the transfer of heat.
